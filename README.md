## Project description
In this app you can add new invoices, which are added to Firebase realtime db. You need to enter recipient and supplier details, select due date (30 and 60 days), and enter products or/and services. You can also save draft for each recipient, fetch all invoices and view their details. At the end I want to add registration and authentication module.
